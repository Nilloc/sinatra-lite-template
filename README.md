# Sinatra Application Template Lite Edition
A base Sinatra application template. Just fork and build. Yay!
Just for static and simpler Haml based sites, like when you need something freely hosted on Heroku.
Deployable to Heroku.

## Configuration
No configuration necessary, you can just either drop html files in the public folder, or start hamling it up (sorry) in the views directory.

## Getting Started

<tt>$ shotgun</tt>

## Spawning a site on heroku

Edit <tt>cp spawn.heroku.example.sh spawn.heroku.sh</tt>
Then run spawn.heroku.sh
